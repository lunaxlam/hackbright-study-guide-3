Q: What are HTML elements?
A: The fundamental building blocks of an HTML page are known as an "HTML element". 
Some elements require a closing tag and others are self-closing. 
They can also be set to a specific attribute.

Q: What are HTML element attributes? What are some examples of HTML attributes and what do they do?
A: Attributes enable an HTML element to be configured to have more customizability and/or functionality. 
For example, an HTML element can be assigned a particular class or ID element to help organize our code but to also enable CSS customization.
An HTML element can also have particular type attributes to configure form functionality. 

Q: In an HTML element, what does the id attribute do? The class attribute?
A: An ID attribute should be assigned to only one element. It allows us to create a very specific attribute identifier for that element and thus, specific CSS customization.
A class attribute can be assigned to more than one element. Any CSS styling that affects one class attribute will affect all members of that class.
